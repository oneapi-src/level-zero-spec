details:
    - "The application must only use the image view for the device, or its sub-devices, which was provided during creation."
    - "The application may call this function from simultaneous threads."
    - "The implementation of this function must be thread-safe."
    - "The implementation must support $X_image_view extension."
    - "Image views are treated as images from the API."
    - "Image views provide a mechanism to redescribe how an image is interpreted (e.g. different format)."
    - "Image views become disabled when their corresponding image resource is destroyed."
    - "Use $xImageDestroy to destroy image view objects."
