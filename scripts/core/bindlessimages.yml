            [in] image flags.
            must be 0 (default) or a valid value of $x_image_bindless_exp_flag_t
            default behavior is bindless images are not used when creating handles via $xImageCreate.
            When the flag is passed to $xImageCreate, then only the memory for the image is allocated.
            Additional image handles can be created with $xImageViewCreateExt.
            When $X_IMAGE_BINDLESS_EXP_FLAG_SAMPLED_IMAGE flag is passed, $x_sampler_desc_t must be attached via pNext member of $x_image_bindless_exp_desc_t.
