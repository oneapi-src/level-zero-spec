details:
    - |
      If the shared-allocation is owned by multiple devices (i.e. nullptr
      was passed to $xMemAllocShared when creating it), then hDevice may be
      passed to set the attributes in that specific device. If nullptr is
      passed in hDevice, then the atomic attributes are set in all devices
      associated with the allocation.
    - |
      If the atomic access attribute select is not supported by the driver,
      $X_RESULT_INVALID_ARGUMENT is returned.
    - |
      The atomic access attribute may be only supported at a device-specific
      granularity, such as at a page boundary. In this case, the memory range
      may be expanded such that the start and end of the range satisfy granularity
      requirements.
    - |
      The application must not call this function for shared-allocations currently
      being used by the device.
    - |
      The application must **not** call this function from simultaneous threads
      with the same pointer.
    - |
      The implementation of this function should be lock-free.
