desc: "Ensures in-bound writes to the device are globally observable."
class: $xContext
name: SystemBarrier
details:
    - |
      This is a special-case system level barrier that can be used to ensure global observability of writes; 
      typically needed after a producer (e.g., NIC) performs direct writes to the device's memory (e.g., Direct RDMA writes).
      This is typically required when the memory corresponding to the writes is subsequently accessed from a remote device.

    - "The implementation of this function should be lock-free."
