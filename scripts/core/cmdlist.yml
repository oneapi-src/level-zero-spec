    - name: RELAXED_ORDERING
      desc: |
            driver may reorder commands (e.g., kernels, copies) between barriers and synchronization primitives.
            using this flag may increase Host overhead of $xCommandListClose.
            therefore, this flag should **not** be set for low-latency usage-models.
    - name: MAXIMIZE_THROUGHPUT
      desc: |
            driver may perform additional optimizations that increase execution throughput. 
            using this flag may increase Host overhead of $xCommandListClose and $xCommandQueueExecuteCommandLists.
            therefore, this flag should **not** be set for low-latency usage-models.
    - name: EXPLICIT_ONLY
      desc: |
            command list should be optimized for submission to a single command queue and device engine.
            driver **must** disable any implicit optimizations for distributing work across multiple engines.
            this flag should be used when applications want full control over multi-engine submission and scheduling.
    - name: IN_ORDER
      version: "1.7"
      desc: |
            commands appended to this command list are executed in-order, with driver implementation
            enforcing dependencies between them. Application is not required to have the signal event
            of a given command being the wait event of the next to define an in-order list, and
            application is allowed to pass signal and wait events to each appended command to implement
            more complex dependency graphs. Cannot be combined with $X_COMMAND_LIST_FLAG_RELAXED_ORDERING.
