            command queue should be optimized for submission to a single device engine.
            driver **must** disable any implicit optimizations for distributing work across multiple engines.
            this flag should be used when applications want full control over multi-engine submission and scheduling.
    - name: IN_ORDER
      version: "1.7"
      desc: |
            To be used only when creating immediate command lists. Commands appended to the immediate command
            list are executed in-order, with driver implementation enforcing dependencies between them.
            Application is not required to have the signal event of a given command being the wait event of
            the next to define an in-order list, and application is allowed to pass signal and wait events
            to each appended command to implement more complex dependency graphs.
