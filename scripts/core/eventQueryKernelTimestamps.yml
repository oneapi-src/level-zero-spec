    - "For collecting *only* kernel timestamps, the application must ensure the event was created from an event pool that was created using $X_EVENT_POOL_FLAG_KERNEL_TIMESTAMP flag."
    - "For collecting synchronized timestamps, the application must ensure the event was created from an event pool that was created using $X_EVENT_POOL_FLAG_KERNEL_MAPPED_TIMESTAMP flag. Kernel timestamps are also available from this type of event pool, but there is a performance cost."
    - "The destination memory will be unmodified if the event has not been signaled."
    - "The application may call this function from simultaneous threads."
    - "The implementation of this function must be thread-safe."
    - "The implementation of this function should be lock-free."
    - "The implementation must support $X_extension_event_query_kernel_timestamps."
    - "The implementation must return all timestamps for the specified event and device pair."
    - "The implementation must return all timestamps for all sub-devices when device handle is parent device."
    - "The implementation may return all timestamps for sub-devices when device handle is sub-device or may return 0 for count."

                - Buffer(s) for query results must be sized by the application to accommodate a minimum of `*pCount` elements.

                - if `*pCount` is less than the number of event packets available, the driver may only update `*pCount` elements, starting at element zero.
                - if `*pCount` is greater than the number of event packets available, the driver may only update the valid elements.
