Security Version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This feature helps to prevent flashing of older firmware that have certain security vulnerabilities by using an hardware enforced anti-rollback scheme. 
User can flash a firmware image and sets its version as the security version number (SVN). Images with lower SVN cannot be applied to device with 
higher SVN for security considerations.

    // Fetch current security version from the fuses
    char* version = allocate(version_size);

    // Set security version
    :ref:`zesFirmwareSetSecurityVersionExp`\(hFirmware);
