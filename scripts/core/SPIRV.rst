 SPIR-V Programming Guide
==========================

Introduction
============

`SPIR-V <https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/>`__ is an open,
royalty-free, standard intermediate language capable of representing
parallel compute kernels. SPIR-V is adaptable to multiple execution
environments: a SPIR-V module is consumed by an execution environment,
as specified by a client API. This document describes the SPIR-V
execution environment for the ${OneApi} Level-Zero API. The SPIR-V
execution environment describes required support for some SPIR-V
capabilities, additional semantics for some SPIR-V instructions, and
additional validation rules that a SPIR-V binary module must adhere to
in order to be considered valid.

This document is written for compiler developers who are generating
SPIR-V modules intended to be consumed by the ${OneApi} Level-Zero API,
for implementors of the ${OneApi} Level-Zero API, and for software
developers who are using SPIR-V modules with the ${OneApi} Level-Zero
API.

Common Properties
=================

This section describes common properties of all ${OneApi} Level-Zero
environments that consume SPIR-V modules.

A SPIR-V module is interpreted as a series of 32-bit words in host
endianness, with literal strings packed as described in the SPIR-V
specification. The first few words of the SPIR-V module must be a magic
number and a SPIR-V version number, as described in the SPIR-V
specification.

Supported SPIR-V Versions
-------------------------

The maximum SPIR-V version supported by a device is described by ${x}_device_module_properties_t.spirvVersionSupported.

Extended Instruction Sets
-------------------------

The **OpenCL.std** `extended instruction set for
OpenCL <https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/>`__ is supported.

Source Language Encoding
------------------------

The source language version is purely informational and has no semantic
meaning.

Numerical Type Formats
----------------------

Floating-point types are represented and stored using
`IEEE-754 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2008.4610935>`__ semantics.
All integer formats are represented and stored using 2's-complement
format.

Supported Types
---------------

The following types are supported. Note that some types may require
additional capabilities, and may not be supported by all environments.

Basic Scalar and Vector Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**OpTypeVoid** is supported.

The following scalar types are supported:

-  **OpTypeBool**
-  **OpTypeInt**, with *Width* equal to 8, 16, 32, or 64, and with
   *Signedness* equal to zero, indicating no signedness semantics.
-  **OpTypeFloat**, with *Width* equal to 16, 32, or 64.

**OpTypeVector** vector types are supported. The vector *Component Type*
may be any of the scalar types described above. Supported vector
*Component Counts* are 2, 3, 4, 8, or 16.

**OpTypeArray** array types are supported, **OpTypeStruct** struct types
are supported, **OpTypeFunction** functions are supported, and
**OpTypePointer** pointer types are supported.

Image-Related Data Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table describes the supported **OpTypeImage** image types:

Kernels
-------

An **OpFunction** in a SPIR-V module that is identified with
**OpEntryPoint** defines a kernel that may be launched using host API
interfaces.

Kernel Return Types
-------------------

The *Result Type* for an **OpFunction** identified with **OpEntryPoint**
must be **OpTypeVoid**.

-  **OpTypeFloat**
-  **OpTypeStruct**
-  **OpTypeVector**
-  **OpTypePointer**
-  **OpTypeSampler**

Extensions
==========

Intel Subgroups
---------------

${OneApi} Level-Zero API environments must accept SPIR-V modules that
declare use of the ``SPV_INTEL_subgroups`` extension via
**OpExtension**.

When use of the ``SPV_INTEL_subgroups`` extension is declared in the
module via **OpExtension**, the environment must accept modules that
declare the following SPIR-V capabilities:

-  **SubgroupShuffleINTEL**
-  **SubgroupBufferBlockIOINTEL**
-  **SubgroupImageBlockIOINTEL**

The environment must accept the following types for *Data* for the
**SubgroupShuffleINTEL** instructions:

-  Scalars and **OpTypeVectors** with 2, 4, 8, or 16 *Component Count*
   components of the following *Component Type* types:

   -  **OpTypeFloat** with a *Width* of 32 bits (``float``)
   -  **OpTypeInt** with a *Width* of 8 bits and *Signedness* of 0
      (``char`` and ``uchar``)
   -  **OpTypeInt** with a *Width* of 16 bits and *Signedness* of 0
      (``short`` and ``ushort``)
   -  **OpTypeInt** with a *Width* of 32 bits and *Signedness* of 0
      (``int`` and ``uint``)

-  Scalars of **OpTypeInt** with a *Width* of 64 bits and *Signedness*
   of 0 (``long`` and ``ulong``)

Additionally, if the **Float16** capability is declared and supported:

-  Scalars of **OpTypeFloat** with a *Width* of 16 bits (``half``)

Additionally, if the **Float64** capability is declared and supported:

-  Scalars of **OpTypeFloat** with a *Width* of 64 bits (``double``)

The environment must accept the following types for *Result* and *Data*
for the **SubgroupBufferBlockIOINTEL** and **SubgroupImageBlockIOINTEL**
instructions:

-  Scalars and **OpTypeVectors** with 2, 4, or 8 *Component Count*
   components of the following *Component Type* types:

   -  **OpTypeInt** with a *Width* of 32 bits and *Signedness* of 0
      (``int`` and ``uint``)
   -  **OpTypeInt** with a *Width* of 16 bits and *Signedness* of 0
      (``short`` and ``ushort``)

For *Ptr*, valid *Storage Classes* are:

-  **CrossWorkGroup** (``global``)

For *Image*:

-  *Dim* must be *2D*

-  *MS* must be 0 (single-sampled content)

For *Coordinate*, the following types are supported:

-  **OpTypeVectors** with two *Component Count* components of *Component
   Type* **OpTypeInt** with a *Width* of 32 bits and *Signedness* of 0
   (``int2``)

Notes and Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **SubgroupShuffleINTEL** instructions may be placed within
non-uniform control flow and hence do not have to be encountered by all
invocations in the subgroup, however *Data* may only be shuffled among
invocations encountering the **SubgroupShuffleINTEL** instruction.
Shuffling *Data* from an invocation that does not encounter the
**SubgroupShuffleINTEL** instruction will produce undefined results.

There is no defined behavior for out-of-range shuffle indices for the
**SubgroupShuffleINTEL** instructions.

The **SubgroupBufferBlockIOINTEL** and **SubgroupImageBlockIOINTEL**
instructions are only guaranteed to work correctly if placed strictly
within uniform control flow within the subgroup. This ensures that if
any invocation executes it, all invocations will execute it. If placed
elsewhere, behavior is undefined.

There is no defined out-of-range behavior for the
**SubgroupBufferBlockIOINTEL** instructions.

The **SubgroupImageBlockIOINTEL** instructions do support bounds
checking, however they bounds-check to the image width in units of
``uints``, not in units of image elements. This means:

-  If the image has an *Image Format* size equal to the size of a
   ``uint`` (four bytes, for example **Rgba8**), the image will be
   correctly bounds-checked. In this case, out-of-bounds reads will
   return the edge image element (the equivalent of **ClampToEdge**),
   and out-of-bounds writes will be ignored.

-  If the image has an *Image Format* size less than the size of a
   ``uint`` (such as **R8**), the entire image is addressable, however
   bounds checking will occur too late. For this reason, extra care
   should be taken to avoid out-of-bounds reads and writes, since
   out-of-bounds reads may return invalid data and out-of-bounds writes
   may corrupt other images or buffers unpredictably.

The following restrictions apply to the **SubgroupBufferBlockIOINTEL**
instructions:

-  The pointer *Ptr* must be 32-bit (4-byte) aligned for reads, and must
   be 128-bit (16-byte) aligned for writes.

The following restrictions apply to the **SubgroupImageBlockIOINTEL**
instructions:

-  The behavior of the **SubgroupImageBlockIOINTEL** instructions is
   undefined for images with an element size greater than four bytes
   (such as **Rgba32f**).

The following restrictions apply to the
**OpSubgroupImageBlockWriteINTEL** instruction:

-  Unlike the image block read instruction, which may read from any
   arbitrary byte offset, the x-component of the byte coordinate for the
   image block write instruction must be a multiple of four; in other
   words, the write must begin at a 32-bit boundary. There is no
   restriction on the y-component of the coordinate.

Numerical Compliance
====================

The ${OneApi} Level-Zero environment will meet or exceed the numerical
compliance requirements defined in the OpenCL SPIR-V Environment
Specification. See: `Numerical
Compliance <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/2.2/html/OpenCL_Env.html#numerical_compliance>`__.

Image Addressing and Filtering
==============================

The ${OneApi} Level-Zero environment image addressing and filtering
behavior is compatible with the behavior defined in the OpenCL SPIR-V
Environment Specification. See: `Image Addressing and
Filtering <https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/2.2/html/OpenCL_Env.html#image_addressing_and_filtering>`__.
